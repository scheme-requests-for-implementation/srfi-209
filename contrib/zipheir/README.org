Almost three years ago, [[https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-209/msg/15550027/][Marc asked]] for a version of ~define-enum~ that
does most of its work at expansion time.  I've finally gotten around
to it.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to test it directly, since I
haven't found an implementation with ~syntax-case~ and a SRFI 209 port
(with all its dependencies).  I'm working on it and will correct at a
later date anything that's broken.  Patches are welcome, if anyone
cares to look it over.
